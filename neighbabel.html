                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>
                    In many of New York City’s residential neighborhoods, the
                    makeup of the residential neighborhoods is extremely diverse
                    in numerous ways. In the city alone, 200
                    different languages are spoken by New Yorkers. As a result,
                    in individual New York City neighborhoods, one can hear
                    multiple languages being spoken within a single location, none
                    of which are English. These differences in language present
                    a unique challenge to a neighborhood’s local businesses and
                    organizations where they must find a solution to presenting
                    and advertising their events and services in multiple languages.
                    Currently, there are online services such as Meetup.com and
                    Eventbrite where individuals and organizations can advertise
                    their events. On a more local level, small organizations within
                    a neighborhood promote events and services though placement
                    of physical flyers and word of mouth. While the current
                    strategies do the job of increasing awareness to an audience,
                    it does not meet the needs of a multilingual population.
                    Many online event planning sites have little or no participation
                    from non-English speaking audiences and small organizations have
                    few or no available resources to accommodate advertising in
                    multiple languages.
                </p>

                <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    Neighbabel(working title) is a mobile application which
                    decreases the barrier of community participation by giving
                    organizations the ability ask, from the local area, for
                    assistance on a short-term language related tasks. Additionally,
                    organizations will be able to post for language volunteers,
                    paid or pro-bono. These requests can range from minor language
                    assistance the organization needs, such as translation for some
                    of their advertising and announcement copy, to longer tasks such
                    as assisting event participants in a particular language which
                    the organization would otherwise not have the manpower to
                    support. In order to ensure that businesses and community
                    organizations get the best quality translation service, this
                    app has been designed from a data-driven perspective. This is
                    accomplished through the individual facing request feature of
                    the app. Individual residents have ability to post a translation
                    request for something they need during their days, such as
                    asking for help speaking to someone who they don’t speak
                    the language off, or help interpreting a document. Using these
                    individual requests, the app can record metrics about how well
                    the responding translator fulfills the request. Based on these
                    metrics, the app can determine which translators would likely
                    provide the best translator for an organization’s request.
