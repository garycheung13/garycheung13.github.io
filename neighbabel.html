        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
            In many of New York City’s residential neighborhoods, the residents are diverse in a number of ways. One such ways, which defines the essence of the city, is the diversity in languages spoken within an individual neighborhood. In many neighborhoods, it would be possible to walk through and hear a number of different languages, none of which are English. These differences in languages, while quintessential to New York City’s diversity as a whole, poses a unique challenge for a neighborhood’s local organizations and businesses whom lack of the time and/or resources to promote their services and events to a multitude of groups which speak many different languages. As such, language barriers limit the overall impact and reach that local organizations can have within a given New York City neighborhood.
        </p>

        <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
        <p>
            My prototype—Neighbabel, is a app that acts a person nearby service for diverse neighborhoods where language needs are common. It uses one of these neighborhoods’ greatest resources: it’s people. In particular, bilingual and multi-lingual people who can act as a bridge between parties which otherwise would have trouble communicating. The app’s strategy revolves around its three main features.

                    <br>
                    On the ground level, Neighbabel allows locals to ask their neighbors for language assistance by making a request through the app with a recommend/not recommended system.

                    <br>
                    Local organizations can offer a small bounty (0-$100 dollars) to ask for help with a translation need they related to their services. Since these are paid requests, the visibility to responding users will be based on participation on individual requests.

                    <br>
                    To build community and trust, Neighbabel prioritizes who can respond to a request based on pre-existing connections a requester and a responder might have. This is accomplished by detecting shared address book data between the two parties and sorting availability of responders to a request based on that data.

                    I first defined the problem that I was going to try to solve, and estimate how wide in scope my solution should be. Initially, I wanted to think about a solution to the increasing community engagement in New York City. As I learned more, I realized that the scope was far to broad so I narrowed the scope to focusing on langauge barriers in neighborhood engagement.

                    <b>Comparative Analysis:</b> I looked several other products which offered features that may solve the problem. <br> <br>
                    <b>User Interviews:</b> I spent time interviewing 3 members of the target audience to better understand their needs, which I factored into when considering potential features for my solution. <br><br>
                    <b>Personas:</b> Once I was done conducting Interviews, I created personas to describe the different stakeholders in my target audience, as well as an anti-persona to remind myself who I wasn't designing for.

                    I spent time sketching 8 different potential solutions for the scoped problem. Afterwards, created a 5 panel workflow for each of the 8 solutions.

                    <b>Low-Fi Prototype:</b> Based on the interviews and personas that had, I chose one solution that had and fleshed it out into a pen and paper (low-fi) prototype. The prototype very rough had the interactions I had in mind. <br><br>
                    <b>User Testing:</b> After the low-fi prototype was completed, I tested the prototype with 3 users to get feedback on which interaction worked, and which were flawed and lead users to get stuck. <br><br>
                    <b>Interactive Prototype &amp; Iterate:</b> Using the feedback I got while testing my intial paper prototype, I created my inital digital prototype. At this stage, smaller details such as shapes of buttons and colors were thought more carefully about. I continued to test the interactions of the prototype in each iteration until the deadline of the project.
