                <h2>Project Context</h2>
                <p>
                    EMX Systems is a medical company aiming to solving the
                    inefficiencies in the exchange of medical information between
                    different healthcare systems. Currently, healthcare providers
                    are required to store patient records in a EMR system. However,
                    none of these systems can interact with another. This means
                    that when patient wants to see a doctor who is using different
                    EMR software, the patient must physically obtain their, or that
                    doctor must request that records be faxed over after getting
                    permission from that patient. Either way, patientcare gets delayed.
                    EMX Systems plans to solve this problem by consolidating all of
                    patient’s available records to a centralized location, thereby
                    skipping the delays of current health information exchange methods.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Job</h2>
                <p>
                    Our job as designers for EMX systems is to understand the
                    needs of medical professionals, and design a user interface
                    that matched their needs. For this project We solved for the
                    information architecture, visual design, and UI design of EMX
                    systems. We also conducted in-depth user research in order
                    understand the needs of our users.
                </p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    As a small design team, members of our team wore many hats.
                    During user research, I was involved in conducting two user
                    interviews, participating in the qualitative analysis, and
                    working on other research tasks including comparative analysis,
                    personas, and journey mapping. During the design phase, I
                    contributed several screens to every iteration of the prototype.
                    (Some prototype screens in this case study have been worked on
                    by my teammates.) I was also responsible for putting together to
                    the final visual and UI guideline deliverable given to the
                    client at the end of the project.

        <h6>Contextual Inquiry</h6>
        <h2>Learning About Our Users</h2>
        <p>
            Our first step in designing EMX was to understand our users – medical
            practitioners. Because our team did not have any domain knowledge
            in this area, we felt it would be crucial for us to conduct thorough
            user research during this phase. To do so, we employed contextual
            inquiry, a qualitative data analysis process to discover our users’
            needs and frustrations. This process entailed conducted numerous
            interviews our users, followed by performing a qualitative analysis
            of our interview findings called building an affinity wall – a
            hierarchical diagram in which similar notes are grouped into high
            level statements.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/imgs/emx-affinity.png" alt="affinity wall" class="process-section-break process-image">

        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>
            By building the affinity wall, our team made several key discoveries
            about our users in relation to EMR systems and their workflows.
        </p>
        <ul class="case-process-list clearfix">
            <li>
                <h2>Records come in many types</h2>
                <p>
                    Patient records came in many different formats depending on
                    where they are from. Some examples include a doctor’s note
                    from general visit which is plain text, a tabular list of
                    results from a blood test, or an image from a CT scan.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Workarounds are needed</h2>
                <p>
                    Patient files which come from other EMR Systems are given a
                    generic description leading to excessive guesswork to find
                    specific records. Additionally, Images and scanned documents
                    can arrive in an unusable quality.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Visitors are Welcomed</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside records are vital in a doctor’s work, many of our
                    interviewees estimated that over 50% of their patients come
                    from outside hospitals and medical offices.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>One side does not fit all</h2>
                <p>
                    Depending the specialty, every doctor sees different types
                    of records as “important”. A general medicine doctor would
                    find a summary important, but a cardiologist would rather
                    see a blood cell count.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Information overload</h2>
                <p>
                    Current EMRs have too many functions that our interviewees
                    thought were unnecessary for their day-to-day. Many memorize
                    specific steps, and find it confusing wandering outside of
                    those steps.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Don't Make me Type</h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our interviewees voiced dislike for typing into
                    their current EMR systems. Several interviewees preferred to
                    voice records to dictate notes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <h6>Comparative Analysis</h6>
            <h2>Who Else is Playing </h2>
            <p>
                After learning more about our users, we wanted to know more about
                other companies working on solutions to the same problem. We put
                together a comparative analysis 2 x 2 matrix where we evaluated
                a set of common features of direct competitors. During this step,
                we also looked at analogous systems, namely other products that
                preformed their own data aggregation, to gather ideas about how
                similar functions in EMX could potentially be designed.

        <h6>Personas &amp; Scenarios</h6>
        <h2>Putting our Research Together </h2>
        <p>
            Before proceeding we the design phase, our team synthesized our
            qualitative research into a persona and journey map artifacts which
            we both gave as deliverable to our client, and used as reference
            during later steps of our design process.
        </p>

        <h2>Identifying Audience Subgroups</h2>
        <p>
            Our personas were based on our research capture three distinctly
            different segments of our audience. These helped us visualize the
            different needs of sub-groups in a more concrete way. In particular,
            identifying different personas in regards comfort with technology
            reminded us that we should design UI to be clear and simple but also
            include some expert shortcuts for more tech-oriented users.

        </div>

        <h2>Visualizing Workflows</h2>
        <p>
            As our final user research deliverable, our team put together a user
            journey map in which we mapped out the phases a user goes through
            whilst attempting to access outside medical records. The exact steps
            taken and the frustrations users had each one were determined at each
            phase. I found this exercise particularly interesting because at this
            point, our team had generated a ton of research notes and this task
            distilled it down into more concise terms.

            <h6>Introducing EMX Systems</h6>
            <h2>A Solution to the Health Record Exchange Problem</h2>
            <p>
                EMX Systems has a vision of connecting the health information
                between providers in order to eliminate the inefficiencies and
                costs that come with current methods of moving health information.
                EMX aims to provide an efficient, centralized location in which
                doctors can find all of their patients records, and make decisions
                with complete information, thereby eliminating the costs of waiting
                for information.

        <h6>Ideation &amp; Wireframing</h6>
        <h2>Sketching Before Sketch</h2>
        <p>
            Before creating anything on a computer, our team first created our
            own wireframes which we brought used to build one unified wireframe
            in a whiteboard. I found approach very effective because it encouraged
            our team to share what our own separate initial ideas of what EMX
            should look like. In doing so, our discussion enabled our team to
            form a unified vision how EMX should look and behavior.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/imgs/emx-sketches.png" alt="emx sketches" class="process-image process-section-break">

        <h2>Putting the Patient first</h2>
        <p>
            During the early wireframing stages, creating a feed in which the
            users could view their patient’s records at a glance was something
            that I strongly advocated for. I hypothesized that our users would
            find the latest records about patient most useful because our
            interviewees suggested that patients would come mentioning something
            that happened in another encounter. I based this hypothesis off our
            research. Several of our interviewees had mentioned that patients coming
            to see them and mention something done to them during a recent
            encounter but didn’t know the term describe what happened.
        </p>
        <div class="case-process-quote">
            <hr>
            <p>
                "Several of our interviewees had mentioned that patients coming
                to see them and mention something done to them during a recent
                encounter but didn’t know the term describe what happened."
            </p>
            <hr>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the initial stages, the dashboard was depicted as single feed but
            this evolved soon multiple. Discussions about this aspect of EMX lead
            to a reminder that different doctors value different information
            differently, and it would be key for use to separate the different
            types of records. As such, the design of the dashboard evolved into
            several cards, which display different types of records.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/imgs/emx-dashhistory.png" alt="dashboard history" class="process-image process-section-break">

        <h2>Goal-Oriented Functions</h2>
        <p>
            We spent a lot of time attempting to understand the way doctors use
            the information they retrieve. During our initial prototype, we
            made a flawed assumption that our users would open a record to
            read it. After showing the prototype to users, we learned this was
            simply not true. Depending what type of information is into the record,
            our users used the information differently. This lead our team to
            investigate further, and held a meeting with one of our interviewees,
            who clarified our misconceptions. While not exhaustive, we generalized
            three key ways that doctors use different types of records.
        </p>
        <ul class="case-para-list">
            <li><span>Review:</span> Checking record made by another practitioner to understand the results of their findings</li>
            <li><span>Comparison:</span> Looking at 2+ records of the same type to figure out the difference between them</li>
            <li><span>Reference:</span> Pulling together multiple records of the different types to get a complete understanding of a patient’s status </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Reviewing records was pretty clear, but we still needed answer
            to how we could allow our users to make comparisons and or
            reference multiple different types of records. To do so, we
            looked back at our comparative analysis with our users in mind.
            To do comparison, we ultimately look inspiration how from many
            shopping websites did their comparison.
        </p>

        <h2>Tailor-made Experience</h2>
        <p>
            One of our goals when designing EMX was to design a system which
            catered to the workflow of our users. As per our research, different
            doctors found different record types important, and we wanted to meet
            that need. Our attempt at creating is feature revolved around a
            customization button, but that button was hotly debated and moved
            around frequently during different prototype iterations.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/imgs/emx-customize.png" alt="history of customization in EMX" class="process-image process-section-break">
        <p>
            Ultimately, the functionality ended up being tucked into the
            “see more” section of the interface. This decision was initially
            tough to make but when we referred back to our interviews, we found
            an off-hand comment from out interviewees which we overlooked which
            answered some of our concerns. The interviewee mentioned that “once
            a doctor figures their workflow, it will become very repetitive”.

                felt that usability testing with our hi-fi prototyping was
                important to validate our decisions and test assumptions we
                may have made. It was fortunate that we did so, because we
                discovered several changes we had to make based on our testing.
            </p>

            <h2>Language Differences</h2>
            <p>
                We learned from testing that some of the terms we used had be
                modified because they held specific meanings in our users’
                domain. In our initial prototype, we used the term “history” as
                label a list of encounters it turned out that it was the wrong
                word to use. One user said, “When I see the word history, I think
                of the history of this patient’s diagnosis.” It turned
                out our label was confusing users!

            </div>

            <p>
                Once this discovery was made, our team had quick meeting
                and changed the label to “encounter history”, which was
                much better received when shown to users.

            <h2>My Sort is Different Than Your Sort</h2>
            <p>
                Our team made the assumption that doctors would look for a specific
                imaging based on name. When we showed users the prototype,
                we learned that this was not true. In practice, images are loaded
                in EMR systems with distinct enough titles to search by name.
                Our users preferred to search for medical imaging related documents
                via name of the image type (e.g. CT Scan, Chest X-ray, Lower
                Back X-ray).
            </p>

            <p>To accommodate for this discovery, the filter feature in EMX was redesigned to allow filtering by different types.</p>

        <p>
            Our client was very satisfied with our final results. After some
            minor visual tweaks, we sent our client our final deliverables,
            which included a visual identity guide, a UI library, and working
            interactive prototype.
