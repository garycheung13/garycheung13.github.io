        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
            In many of New York City’s residential neighborhoods, the residents are diverse in a number of ways. One such ways, which defines the essence of the city, is the diversity in languages spoken within an individual neighborhood. In many neighborhoods, it would be possible to walk through and hear a number of different languages, none of which are English. These differences in languages, while quintessential to New York City’s diversity as a whole, poses a unique challenge for a neighborhood’s local organizations and businesses whom lack of the time and/or resources to promote their services and events to a multitude of groups which speak many different languages. As such, language barriers limit the overall impact and reach that local organizations can have within a given New York City neighborhood.
        </p>

        <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
        <p>
            My prototype—Neighbabel, is a app that acts a person nearby service for diverse neighborhoods where language needs are common. It uses one of these neighborhoods’ greatest resources: it’s people. In particular, bilingual and multi-lingual people who can act as a bridge between parties which otherwise would have trouble communicating. The app’s strategy revolves around its three main features.

        <ul class="feature-bullets">
            <li>
                <span class="feature-header">Feature 1: Connect people who need translations to people who can do it</span>
                <br>
                On the ground level, Neighbabel allows locals to ask their neighbors for language assistance by making a request through the app with a recommend/not recommended system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="feature-header">Feature 2: Enable local businesses to get help through incentivized requests</span>
                <br>
                Local organizations can offer a small bounty (0-$100 dollars) to ask for help with a translation need they related to their services. Since these are paid requests, the visibility to responding users will be based on participation on individual requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="feature-header">Feature 3: Build trust through emphasis on real life connections</span>
                <br>
                To build community and trust, Neighbabel prioritizes who can respond to a request based on pre-existing connections a requester and a responder might have. This is accomplished by detecting shared address book data between the two parties and sorting availability of responders to a request based on that data.
