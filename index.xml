      <description>Project Overview  Summary This project was completed on behalf of our client, EMX Systems, a healthcare startup developing a medical record exchange system that aggregates patient records from separate electronic medical record(EMR) systems to provide doctors with faster and more complete information about their patients.

We did so using the following process.

The directory has two main uses – for members of university of look up contact information about other people affiliated with the University, and building “groups” for official and student organizations which be used as an alternative to listservs for mass emailing.
Research Objectives The team working the MCommunity platform has began work on a new beta platform and has asked our team to conduct user experience research to determine the inclusion of new features and improvements on existing features.</description>
