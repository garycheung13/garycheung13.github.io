      <description>Project Overview  Summary EMX Systems is a early stage startup healthcare company based in Michigan developing a health information exchange platform to improve the process in which healthcare information transferred between healthcare providers using different electronic medical records (EMR) systems. Their planned platform includes an intranet web application in which doctors and other healthcare professionals can securely access patient records no matter which EMR system it originated from.
