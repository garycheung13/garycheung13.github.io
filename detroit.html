                <h2>Data Driven Detroit</h2>
                <h4>Who is D3</h4>
                <p>
                    Data Driven Detroit (D3) is a low-profit LLC whose aim is to provide data analysis services to public institutions in the southeast Michigan, with the focus on Detroit,
                    to help public leaders make better, evidence driven decisions. D3 aims to cover the gamut of data analysis services for the public sector—they provide a wide range of data services including data collection,
                    visualization, and interpretation. Many of their projects are initiated through partnerships with other local nonprofits who use D3’s data to advance their own missions. In addition to the D3’s nonprofit projects,
                    they also aim to provide the greater Michigan community with better data and make much of their collected data openly available for public view and use.
                </p>

                <h4>The proposed problem</h4>
                <p>
                    D3 proposed the question of how they they should should
                    impove their the design of their internal database to our
                    Contextual Inquiry class. I worked in a group with 3 other
                    students to form a consulting group to begin helping them
                    with the proposed problem.
                 </p>

                <h4>Methodology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Contact:</b> Our first action after being assigned Data
                            driven Detroit was to make contact with our client
                            and arrange an initial meeting at their office in
                            Detroit. There, we became better acquainted with the
                            proposed problem, scoped the depth of our project,
                            and identified five potential employees to interview
                            for our project.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Research:</b> Our group held a meeting after the initial client
                            meeting to decide on topics of interest for research
                            related to our client’s industry sector. Each member
                            of the group reviewed literature related to their topic
                            and composed a 2,000-word report on it. Based on the
                            collaborated information all of our reports, we constructed
                            an interview protocol for each interviewee.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Interviews:</b> Once our interview protocols were finalized,
                            formed two-person teams to conduct each interview
                            (based on time availability of both the interviewees
                            and our group members). Individually, we reached out
                            to each interviewee for an interview in their office.
                            Each interview was to approximately 60-90 minutes long,
                            and would include a period of work observation. At the
                            end of each interview, our group got together to hold a
                            meeting to interpret and discuss notes from our latest
                            interview.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Afffinity Wall:</b> (Shown below) After we finished conducting
                            all five interviews, we processed our findings through
                            a qualitative analysis process called an affinity wall.
                            The affinity wall is a hierarchical diagram where each
                            successive level looks at the problem from a higher-level
                            perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To accomplish this task, we first broke down the notes
                            from our interviews into individual statements and quotes,
                            each of which went a separate yellow post-it. These yellow
                            notes were grouped by topic and a blue note summarizing each
                            group of yellow notes was posted above it. Once that phase
                            was completed, we aggregated groups of blue notes together
                            to draw a conclusion and created pink notes. Finally, on
                            the highest level, we created green notes which summated
                            the information on the pink notes on the highest level.
                        </p>

                <h4>Outcomes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Key Finding:</b>We determined through this process that D3’s challenges with designing their internal database structure were not, as were not technical, as initially accessed. We learned that D3 some internal communication issues have surfaced during the course of their startup’s growth, which has impeded progress on their database. The dedication analysts gave to external projects had caused communication with programmers working on internal projects to falter. While the construction of the database is an internal project, ultimately, the primary users will be the analysts working on external projects. Thusly, lack of communication created a major obstacle in development of a successful database since the needs of the users have not be considered with enough depth in the specifications of the database design.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Key Recommendation:</b> In our final deliverable to D3, we included numerous recommendations, but the one primary recommendation we determined was to hold meetings between internal and external teams specifically discussing the progress of the database. D3 has already held meetings related to external projects to great success, and we believe that the same process can be implemented for their database project.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Outcome:</b> After synthesizing recommendations, we created a 15-page consulting report documenting all of our methodologies, findings, and recommendations. In addition, we also gave a presentation on our findings and recommendations to leaders in D3. Our report was well received by the organization, and we were informed that several of our recommendations been given serious planning for implementation at the organization.
