<h3 class="toc-header" id="project-overview"> Project Overview </h3>

<h4 id="who-is-the-client">Who is the client?</h4>

<p>MCommunity is an online people directory built by the IT Services department within the University of Michigan. The directory has two main uses – for members of university of look up contact information about other people affiliated with the University, and building “groups” for official and student organizations which be used as an alternative to listservs for mass emailing.</p>

<h4 id="research-objectives">Research Objectives</h4>

<p>The team working the MCommunity platform has began work on a new beta platform and has asked our team to conduct user experience research to determine the inclusion of new features and improvements on existing features.</p>




<h3 class="toc-header" id="interaction-map"> Interaction Map </h3>

<p>Our first research deliverable was an interaction map, where we mapped out interaction flows of the main functions (person lookup &amp; contact information editing) of the current beta release of the MCommunity platform.</p>

        <h4>The digital version of our affinity map, used to group our interview data.</h4>

</figure>





<h3 class="toc-header" id="user-interviews"> User Interviews </h3>

<p>With the help of our client, we conducted five interviews with five MCommunity users with different roles in the university, such as students and administrators to learn more about MCommunity’s user needs.</p>

<h4 id="interview-insights">Interview Insights</h4>

<p>Based on these interviews, we made three key findings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A good mass emailing function is important because of the platform’s affiliation with the university, emails do not get caught by spam filters and get higher visibility.</p></li>

<li><p>Many users forget to update contact information, and it makes search less useful.</p></li>

<li><p>Users dislike the fact that the platform makes it difficult to leave a group.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="personas">Personas</h4>

<h3 class="toc-header" id="comparative-analysis"> Comparative Analysis </h3>

<p>We conducted a comparative analysis where we looked at several products to look for possible features which could solve the user needs we learned about from our interviews.</p>

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>





<h3 class="toc-header" id="surveys"> Surveys </h3>

<p>We conducted a survey, which received 89 responses, to learn more about user preferences and frustrations with the platform. The survey confirmed many of things we learned from our earlier interviews, and we also learned that MCommunity users mainly use the platform on desktop, with little mobile usage.</p>




<h3 class="toc-header" id="heurstic-evaluation"> Heurstic Evaluation </h3>

<p>We evaluated the current MCommunity beta for potential usability problems use Neilsen’s 10 usability principles. Our team met to determine a common set of criteria to evaluate the website from and then each conducted an individual evaluation. For each criterion, the severalty of the problem was rated from 0 (no problem at all) to 4 (major problem, must fix before release).</p>

<p>Our team made 3 key findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We determined that documentation for how to use features was difficult to access. It actually require leaving the website and visiting the main UM IT department site. To solve this problem, we recommended that a tab to direct users to documentation be added to MCommunity&rsquo;s navigation options.</p></li>

<li><p>There is no mechanism to prevent users from forgetting to save their changes before exiting the page. We recommended that the system should show an alert if the user has made changes and has attempted to leave without saving.</p></li>

<li><p>The differences in access-level with different group membership roles (member/moderator/admin) are poorly conveyed, which lead to a lot of confusion during our evaluation about what actions were possible in each role. We recommended that these user access-levels be defined on the landing page of the group to make difference more clear to users.</p></li>
</ul>




<h3 class="toc-header" id="usability-testing"> Usability Testing </h3>

<p>We conducted 5 usability tests on the group creation and management process of MCommunity. Participant recruitment was done reaching out to our group members individual networks. Each test followed a procedure of a pre-test questionnaire, a completing 5 tasks related to group management, and a post test survey. Once all tests were completed, our team analyzed our results and made 3 key findings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During many of our tests, we observed that many participants failed to notice the save changes button and exited and lost all of their changes. To combat this issue, we suggusted that save changes button be moved to a different position and include a warning if there are unsaved changes.</p></li>

<li><p>One important feature of MCommunity that it creates a custom email with an &ldquo;@umich.edu&rdquo; domain upon group creation. This email is important for campus groups because it provides admins with an central email to handle group business. This feature however, was hard to set up for all of our participants and only one successfully completed the task. To resolve this problem, we recommended that clear steps be listed in the FAQs section of documentation.</p></li>

<li><p>When handling group deletion, users are asked to type the name of the group to confirm their action. This caused problems in some tests because the pop-up to enter the group name covers the group name, making it difficult to enter the correct punctuation for the name. This problem was solved by including the group name in the pop-up window so that users have a reference to what they need to type.</p></li>
